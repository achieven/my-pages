This is a my main website from which you can surf into the other websites I built.      
Go to http://achievendar.tk to see it, or test.achievendar.tk if it doesn't work (it could be down due to cost issues, until I decide i'm keeping it on permanently).
Contact me in achievendar@gmail.com if you want to specifically see it live.

git clone https://github.com/achieven/my-pages.git

npm i
